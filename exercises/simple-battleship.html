<p>In this exercise, you will use the concepts learned in Lessons 00 through 04.</p>
<p>This semester, we will take inspiration from the stategy game of Battleship. It‚Äôs usually a two-player game, but you will be coding a single-player version!</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will have a row of boxes (blue for the sea) and you will prompt the user for a number between 1 and 4, corresponding to their guess of at which box a ship is lurking behind. You will then test to see if the user input matches the square with the ship and print out whether it was a hit or a miss, along with a visual of the boxes. You will also notify the user if they inputed a number out of range.</p>
<p>You should follow the steps below for implementing the program one step at a time. To get a sense of where you are going, though, consider what we expect the output to be given some example inputs:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 5
    Error! There are only 4 squares.

    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 3
    üü¶üü¶‚¨úüü¶
    Incorrect! You missed the ship.

    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 2
    üü¶üü•üü¶üü¶
    Correct! You hit the ship.</code></pre>
<h2 id="background-lesson-emoji">Background Lesson: Emoji</h2>
<p>In this exercise you will need to make use of an advanced string concepts: emoji! ü§†</p>
<p>Before beginning work on this exercise, read the following lesson and complete the related questions on Gradescope: <a href="/lessons/strings.html">LS11 - Unicode, Emoji, Escape Sequences, and f-Strings</a></p>
<h2 id="part-0.-setting-up-the-python-program">Part 0. Setting up the Python Program</h2>
<p>In Visual Studio Code, be sure your workspace is open. (Reminder: File &gt; Open Recent &gt; comp110-YYS-workspace is a quick way to reopen it! Where YY is the current year and S is the semeseter: S for Spring, F for Fall.)</p>
<p>Open the Explorer pane (click the icon with two sheets of paper or to to <em>View</em> &gt; <em>Explorer</em>) and expand the <em>Workspace</em> directory.</p>
<p>Right click on the <code>exercises</code> directory and select ‚ÄúNew File‚Äù. Enter the following filename, being careful to match capitalization and punctuation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ex00_simple_battleship.py</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Before beginning work on the program, you should add a <em>docstring</em> to the top of your Python <em>module</em> just as you did in EX00. Then, you should add a line with the special variable named <code>__author__</code> assigned to be a string with your 9-digit student PID. (Disclaimer: Out in the real world the <code>__author__</code> variable is typically your name and e-mail address, but since we will grade your programs we‚Äôd like to avoid potential bias in seeing your names as part of the programs as we‚Äôre grading.) Add the following lines above the line of code that calls the <code>print</code> function. Fill in <em>your</em> 9-digit UNC PID number, without any spaces or dashes, in the <code>__author__</code> string.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;EX01 - One-Shot Battleship - A cute step toward Battleship.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>    __author__ <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;1234567890&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="part-1.-establishing-a-secret-and-prompting-for-inputs-xx-points">Part 1. Establishing a Secret and Prompting for Inputs ‚Äì XX Points</h2>
<p>In your program, establish an <code>int</code> variable to hold your secret number (which box the ship is hidden behind) and initialize it to a secret number of your choice. For troubleshooting purposes, in the Part 1 and 2, please use a secret number of <code>2</code>. You will then level up the game in Part 3 so that you yourself can play the game!</p>
<p>The first task of this program is to decide at which number box the ship is hidden and to gather an input guess from the user. Using the concepts you learned in <a href="https://youtu.be/GPpYSDNUtH8">LS04 - User Input and Variables</a>, you will want to ask the user to enter a number, storing it as an <code>int</code> variable. <strong>Please choose meaningful, descriptive names for your variables.</strong> Write your prompts and diagnostic message such that you can reproduce the following in the shell after saving and running your program:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 3
    User&#39;s guess is 3. Ship is at box 2.
    
    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 2
    User&#39;s guess is 2. Ship is at box 2.</code></pre>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Autograding will very specifically be looking for <em>exactly</em> the format of lines output shown above. You will not see the <code>$</code> at your command-line prompt in VSCode, you can ignore that part. Otherwise, when you run the program on your machine with the same inputs as above on the first two lines, your printed results should look exactly like the 3rd line and 7th line.</p>
<h2 id="part-2.-checking-user-input-for-match-xx-points">Part 2. Checking User Input for Match ‚Äì XX Points</h2>
<p>Now that you have gathered your input from Part 1 and stored it as a variable, your task is to check if the user input is equivalent to the box where the ship is hidden (hint: <em>is equal to</em>). These checks will involve combining concepts you‚Äôve learned in recent lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/lessons/expressions.html">LS03 - Expressions</a>
<ul>
<li>Relational Operators - Equality</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395mlzouM00">LS05 - Conditional if-else Statements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You‚Äôll have to translate the following English logic into Python: <em>If</em> the user‚Äôs input is equal to the secret number, <em>then</em> you should print out a message indicating that the user correctly hit the ship. <em>Else</em>, you should print out a statement that they missed the ship.</p>
<p>Your goal in this part is to be able to do the following:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 3
    Incorrect! You missed the ship.
    
    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 2
    Correct! You hit the ship.</code></pre>
<p>Note: You will be modifying some of your previous print statements. They were there in Part 1 to help you troubleshoot and make sure you were saving the numbers correctly.</p>
<h2 id="part-3.-random---xx-points">Part 3. Random! - XX points</h2>
<p>Okay, wouldn‚Äôt be fun if you didn‚Äôt know the correct box ahead of time? That way <em>you</em> can play the game! Instead of setting the secret number to 2, make it pick a random integer between 1 and 4. Remember, you need to import the <code>randint</code> function from the <code>random</code> package before calling it.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs important that you didn‚Äôt hard code the secret number and instead used its variable name in the checks in Part 2.</p>
<h2 id="part-3.-printing-a-string-of-boxes---xx-points">Part 3. Printing A String of Boxes - XX points</h2>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs bring a visual aid to the game! You will need to build up a string of emojis using concatenation to show where the user hit or missed a boat. You can use the following <em>named constants</em> in your program to simplify your implementation. We will learn more about named constants soon, but for now know they are simply variables whose values you will not change later in your program and make your programs easier to read:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>BLUE_BOX: str = &quot;\U0001F7E6&quot;
RED_BOX: str = &quot;\U0001F7E5&quot;
WHITE_BOX: str = &quot;\U00002B1C&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, create a <code>str</code> guess result variable and modify your current <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> statements in the following way:</p>
<p><em>If</em> the user‚Äôs guess matches your secret number, make the guess result variable red. <em>Else</em>, make the guess result variable white.</p>
<p>Now, you need to start building your string of emoji boxes. Establish another <code>str</code> variable to store the resulting emoji string of the guess and initialize it to an empty string. Essentially, the default box should be blue, unless its the box position that the user correctly or incorrectly picked (red or white, respectively). In the future, you will use <em>loops</em> to make this process more efficient, but for now, you will need a series of <code>if</code> statements to check each possible option. Here‚Äôs an example for the first one:</p>
<p><em>If</em> the user input guess equals 1, concatenate the guess box to the resulting emoji string of boxes. <em>Else</em>, contatenate the blue box.</p>
<p>The logic is similar for all other possible box numbers. After checking for each posible box, print the resulting emoji string of boxes.</p>
<p>Your goal in this part is to be able to do the following (if the random number picked is 2):</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 3
    üü¶üü¶‚¨úüü¶
    Incorrect! You missed the ship.

    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 1
    ‚¨úüü¶üü¶üü¶
    Incorrect! You missed the ship.

    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 2
    üü¶üü•üü¶üü¶
    Correct! You hit the ship.</code></pre>
<p>If you‚Äôre struggling to test and guess the correct number, you can comment out the <code>randint</code> call and hard code any value between 1 and 4 (like we did in the beginning for 2). Your code should still work! Note: when you submit to gradescope, make sure to turn the <code>randint</code> back on.</p>
<h2 id="part-4.-exiting-early-for-invalid-inputs---10-points">Part 4. Exiting Early for Invalid Inputs - 10 points</h2>
<p>What happens if you input a number that‚Äôs larger than 4, that‚Äôs out of bounds? It‚Äôs good practice to handle bad input from an end-user gracefully in your programs. Our strategy, for now, will be to simply print an error message and then exit the program early. There is a special built-in function called <code>exit()</code> that will send a signal to your system and tell the program to quit at that point, not continuing on further in the program. Before attempting to implement the following behavior in your program, think about where it logically <em>makes sense</em> to try adding these checks for correct input.</p>
<p>Here is how your program should work after completing this part:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>    $ python -m exercises.ex00_simple_battleship 
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 5
    Error! There are only 4 squares.</code></pre>
<h2 id="part-6.-type-safety-and-linting---xx-points">Part 6. Type Safety and Linting - XX Points</h2>
<p>The autograder uses industry standard tools for checking the type safety of your programs (e.g.¬†being sure you‚Äôre using variables of the correct data types in valid ways) and linting style rules. If you have point deductions on Type Safety or Linting, read through the feedback the autograder gives and it should direct you to the line number in your program with the issue.</p>
<h2 id="submit-to-gradescope-for-grading">Submit to Gradescope for Grading</h2>
<p>All that‚Äôs left now is to hand-in your work on Gradescope for grading!</p>
<p>Login to Gradescope and select the assignment named ‚ÄúEX01 - Chardle‚Äù. You‚Äôll see an area to upload a zip file. To produce a zip file for autograding, return back to Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>If you <em>do not</em> see a Terminal at the bottom of your screen, open the Command Palette and search for ‚ÄúView: Toggle Integrated Terminal‚Äù.</p>
<p>Type the following command (all on a single line):</p>
<p><code>python -m tools.submission exercises/ex00_simple_battleship.py</code></p>
<p>In the file explorer pane, look to find the zip file named ‚Äúyy.mm.dd-hh.mm-exercises-ex01_chardle.py.zip‚Äù. The ‚Äúyy‚Äù, ‚Äúmm‚Äù, ‚Äúdd‚Äù, and so on, are timestamps with the current year, month, day, hour, minute. If you right click on this file and select ‚ÄúReveal in File Explorer‚Äù on Windows or ‚ÄúReveal in Finder‚Äù on Mac, the zip file‚Äôs location on your computer will open. Upload this file to Gradescope to submit your work for this exercise.</p>
<p>Autograding will take a few moments to complete. For this exercise there will be 10 ‚Äúhuman graded‚Äù points. Thus, you should expect a maximum autograding score of 90 possible points on this assignment. If there are issues reported, you are encouraged to try and resolve them and resubmit. If for any reason you aren‚Äôt receiving full credit and aren‚Äôt sure what to try next, come give us a visit in office hours!</p>
