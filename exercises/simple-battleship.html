<p>This semester, we will take inspiration from the strategy game of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gHJlYLomrs">Battleship</a>!</p>
<p>This exercise is meant to be the first step to building the full game. You will prompt Player 1 to input a secret number between 1 and 4. Then, you will prompt Player 2 to guess the secret number. Then you will tell Player 2 whether or not they guessed correctly (aka whether it was a <em>hit</em> or a <em>miss</em>) using colored boxes. For both player inputs, you will also notify the user if they input a number out of range.</p>
<p>You can follow the steps below for implementing the program one step at a time. To get a sense of where you are going, though, consider what we expect the output to be given some example inputs:</p>
<pre>
<div class="terminal">
    $ python -m exercises.ex01_simple_battleship 
    Pick a secret boat location between 1 and 4: 1
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 3
    üü¶üü¶‚¨úüü¶
    Incorrect! You missed the ship.
</div>
</pre>
<pre>
<div class="terminal">
    $ python -m exercises.ex01_simple_battleship 
    Pick a secret boat location between 1 and 4: 2
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 2
    üü¶üü•üü¶üü¶
    Correct! You hit the ship.
</div>
</pre>
<h2 id="background-lesson-emoji">Background Lesson: Emoji</h2>
<p>In this exercise you will need to make use of an advanced string concepts: emoji! ü§†</p>
<p>Before beginning work on this exercise, read the following lesson and complete the related questions on Gradescope: <a href="/lessons/strings.html">Unicode, Emoji, Escape Sequences, and f-Strings</a></p>
<h2 id="part-0.-setting-up-the-python-program---10-points">Part 0. Setting up the Python Program - 10 points</h2>
<p>In Visual Studio Code, be sure your workspace is open. (Reminder: File &gt; Open Recent &gt; comp110-YYS-workspace is a quick way to reopen it! Where YY is the current year and S is the semeseter: S for Spring, F for Fall.)</p>
<p>Open the Explorer pane (click the icon with two sheets of paper or to to <em>View</em> &gt; <em>Explorer</em>) and expand the <em>Workspace</em> directory.</p>
<p>Right click on the <code>exercises</code> directory and select ‚ÄúNew File‚Äù. Enter the following filename, being careful to match capitalization and punctuation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ex01_simple_battleship.py</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Before beginning work on the program, you should add a <em>docstring</em> to the top of your Python <em>module</em> just as you did in EX00. Then, you should add a line with the special variable named <code>__author__</code> assigned to be a string with your 9-digit student PID. (Disclaimer: Out in the real world the <code>__author__</code> variable is typically your name and e-mail address, but since we will grade your programs we‚Äôd like to avoid potential bias in seeing your names as part of the programs as we‚Äôre grading.) Add the following lines above the line of code that calls the <code>print</code> function. Fill in <em>your</em> 9-digit UNC PID number, without any spaces or dashes, in the <code>__author__</code> string.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;EX01 - Simple Battleship - A cute step toward Battleship.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span></span>

<h2 id="part-1.-prompting-for-player-1-input---15-points">Part 1. Prompting for Player 1 Input - 15 points</h2>
<p>Using the concepts you learned in <a href="https://youtu.be/GPpYSDNUtH8">User Input and Variables</a>, you will want to ask the first user to ‚ÄúPick a secret boat location between 1 and 4:‚Äù, storing their input it as an <code>int</code> variable. <strong>Please choose meaningful, descriptive names for your variables.</strong></p>
<p>If they give a valid input between 1 and 4, the program should exit and print nothing. However, if their input is too low or too high, it should print an error message. Write your prompts and diagnostic message such that you can reproduce the following in the shell after saving and running your program:</p>
<pre>
<div class="terminal">
    $ python -m exercises.ex01_simple_battleship 
    Pick a secret boat location between 1 and 4: 0
    Error! 0 too low!
    
    $ python -m exercises.ex01_simple_battleship 
    Pick a secret boat location between 1 and 4: 5
    Error! 5 too high!

    $ python -m exercises.ex01_simple_battleship 
    Pick a secret boat location between 1 and 4: 3
</div>
</pre>
<p><em>(Hint: f-strings are useful for creating these outputs!)</em></p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Autograding will very specifically be looking for <em>exactly</em> the format of lines output shown above. You will not see the <code>$</code> at your command-line prompt in VSCode, you can ignore that part. Otherwise, when you run the program on your machine with the same inputs as above, your printed results should match exactly.</p>
<h2 id="part-2.-prompting-for-player-2-input---15-points">Part 2. Prompting for Player 2 Input - 15 points</h2>
<p>Now, you will do the same to prompt the second user for input with ‚ÄúGuess a number between 1 and 4:‚Äù and store that under a different variable name. (Imagine Player 1 input their boat location and then passed the computer to Player 2.)</p>
<p>If they give a valid input between 1 and 4, the program should exit and print nothing. However, if their input is too low or too high, it should print an error message.

<h2 id="part-3.-checking-user-input-for-match---20-points">Part 3. Checking User Input for Match - 20 points</h2>
<p>Now that you have gathered your inputs from Part 1 and Part 2 and stored them as variables, your task is to check if Player 2‚Äôs guess <em>is equal to</em> to the box where the ship is hidden. These checks will involve combining concepts you‚Äôve learned in recent lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/lessons/expressions.html">Expressions</a>
<ul>
<li>Relational Operators - Equality</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=395mlzouM00">Conditional if-else Statements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You‚Äôll have to translate the following English logic into Python: <em>If</em> the user‚Äôs input is equal to the secret number, <em>then</em> you should print out a message indicating that the user correctly hit the ship. <em>Else</em>, you should print out a statement that they missed the ship.</p>
<p>Your goal in this part is to be able to do the following:</p>
<pre>
<div class="terminal">
    $ python -m exercises.ex01_simple_battleship 
    Pick a secret boat location between 1 and 4: 2
    Guess a number between 1 and 4: 4
    Incorrect! You missed the ship.

    Correct! You hit the ship.
</div>
</pre>
<h2 id="part-4.-printing-a-string-of-boxes---20-points">Part 4. Printing A String of Boxes - 20 points</h2>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs bring a visual aid to the game! You will need to build up a string of emojis using concatenation to show where the user hit or missed a boat. You can use the following <em>named constants</em> in your program to simplify your implementation. We will learn more about named constants soon, but for now know they are simply variables whose values you will not change later in your program and make your programs easier to read:</p>
<pre><code>    BLUE_BOX: str = &quot;\U0001F7E6&quot;
    RED_BOX: str = &quot;\U0001F7E5&quot;
    WHITE_BOX: str = &quot;\U00002B1C&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, create a <code>str</code> result variable and modify your current <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> statements in the following way:</p>
<p><em>If</em> Player 2‚Äôs guess matches Player 1‚Äôs secret number, set result variable to a red box. <em>Else</em>, set the result variable to a white box.</p>
<p>Now, you need to start building your full string of emoji boxes by establishing another <code>str</code> variable to store it in and initializing that to an empty string. Essentially, the default box should be blue, unless its the box position that the user correctly or incorrectly guessed (red or white, respectively). In the future, you will use <em>loops</em> to make this process more efficient, but for now, you will need a series of <code>if</code> statements to check each possible option. Here‚Äôs an example for the first one:</p>
<p><em>If</em> Player 2‚Äôs guess equals 1, concatenate the guess box to the resulting emoji string of boxes. <em>Else</em>, contatenate the blue box.</p>
<p>The logic is similar for all other possible box numbers. After checking for each posible box, print the resulting emoji string of boxes.</p>
<p>Your goal in this part is to be able to do the following:</p>
<pre>
<div class="terminal">
    $ python -m exercises.ex01_simple_battleship

<h2 id="part-5.-exiting-early-for-invalid-inputs---10-points">Part 5. Exiting Early for Invalid Inputs - 10 points</h2>
<p>Now that you‚Äôve added more functionality to your program in Parts 3 and 4, see what happens when you go back to Parts 1 and 2. If Player 1 inputs an invalid value, what happens? How about when Player 2 inputs an invalid value? You‚Äôll notice that you no longer get your expected outputs from Parts 1 and 2. Instead, the program keeps running and doesn‚Äôt exit immediately.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs good practice to handle bad input from an end-user gracefully in your programs. Our strategy, for now, will be to simply print an error message and then exit the program early. There is a special built-in function called <code>exit()</code> that will send a signal to your system and tell the program to quit at that point, not continuing on further in the program. Before implementing the function in your program, think about when and where it logically <em>makes sense</em> to quit.</p>
<p>Once you make these changes, you should get the expected outputs from Parts 1 and 2 again, while still getting the correct functionality added in Parts 3 and 4.</p>
<h2 id="part-6.-type-safety-and-linting---10-points">Part 6. Type Safety and Linting - 10 points</h2>
<p>The autograder uses industry standard tools for checking the type safety of your programs (e.g.¬†being sure you‚Äôre using variables of the correct data types in valid ways) and linting style rules. If you have point deductions on Type Safety or Linting, read through the feedback the autograder gives and it should direct you to the line number in your program with the issue.</p>
<h2 id="part-7.-hand-grading">Part 7. Hand Grading</h2>
<p>Part of this assignment will be hand graded to make sure you only use concepts within the course.</p>
<p>We expect you to implement this exercise using only the concepts covered in COMP110. If you have prior programming experience, restrict your implementation to only the concepts covered. While there are many ways to implement this program with additional concepts beyond those we have covered, you should not attempt to do so until after submitting this exercise for full credit once the autograder is posted. Gaining additional practice with the fundamentals may feel clunky, but will help ensure you have full command over the concepts we expect you to know. Additionally, it is good practice for working in other programming environments which are more constrained and require creativity to overcome restrictions. For this exercise, you will be penalized for using any kind of loop construct.</p>
